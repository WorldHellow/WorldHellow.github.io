I am PhD candidate under the supervision of Prof. [Goran Glavas](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=Ym0myOwAAAAJ&hl=en) (and co-supervised by Prof. [Anne Lauscher](https://anne-lauscher.de/))  at the [CAIDAS](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/caidas/home/) at the Chair of NLP and I am affiliated with the EQUIFAIR Project. Previously, I was associated with [EUinAction](https://www.euinaction.eu/) project where I collaborated with political scientists from Leiden and Strathclyde Univeristy. I graduated from the [EMLCT Master's Program](https://lct-master.org/) as an Erasmus Mundus scholar with an MSc. in Computer Science and Computational Linguistics from Charles University and, MSc. in Langauge Science and Technology from Saarland University in 2022. My BSc. is in Computer Science which I obtained from [NUST](https://nust.edu.pk/). 

My research focuses on the critical areas of safety, trustworthiness, and reliability in Large Language Models (LLMs), with a specific emphasis on multilingual contexts. As modern language models become more powerful and widely deployed, ensuring their factual accuracy and fairness across different languages and dialects is a paramount challenge. My work aims to identify, analyze, measure, and mitigate the risks associated with these models. My overarching research goal is to contribute to the development of language technologies that are not only powerful but also verifiably safe, factually grounded, and equitable for users across all languages and dialects. As a side note, I am also keen on exploring applications of NLP in social and natural sciences.
