I am PhD candidate under the supervision of Prof. [Goran Glavas](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=Ym0myOwAAAAJ&hl=en)  at the [CAIDAS](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/caidas/home/) at the Chair of NLP and I am affiliated with the EQUIFAIR Project. Previsouly, I was associated with [EUinAction](https://www.euinaction.eu/) project where I collaborated with political scientists from Leiden and Strathclyde Univeristy. I graduated from the [EMLCT Master's Program](https://lct-master.org/) as an Erasmus Mundus scholar with an MSc. in Computer Science and Computational Linguistics from Charles University and, MSc. in Langauge Science and Technology from Saarland University in 2022. My Bachelors is in Computer Science which I obtained from [NUST](https://nust.edu.pk/) My research focuses on multilingual hallucinations and biases. My career goal is to build NLP tools that are easily accessible by the masses.
