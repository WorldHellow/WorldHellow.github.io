I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the [CAIDAS](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/caidas/home/) at the Chair of NLP and I am affiliated with the the project, [EUINACTION](https://www.euinaction.eu/). I recently graduated from the [EMLCT Master's Program](https://lct-master.org/) as an Erasmus Mundus scholar with an MSc. in Computer Science and Computational Linguistics from Charles University and, MSc. in Langauge Science and Technology from Saarland University. I am interested in natural language processing, in particularly, natural langauge generation, factuality, and evaluation. I am also interested in applying Pre-trained/Large Language Models to solve real world tasks (applied NLP). My career goal is to build NLP tools that are easily accessible by the masses.
